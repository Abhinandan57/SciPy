# SciPy
- __Scientific Python (SciPy) is an extension of NumPy for scientific and advanced mathematical algorithms and functions.__
- SciPy builds on NumPy and therefore if you import SciPy, there is no need to import NumPy.
- SciPy comes in useful to deal with the task of multiple domains of Scientific Domain such as Statistics, Spatial Data, Image Science, Mathematical Equations, Platform Integration, Signal Processing, Optimization. It's a Python library which has built-in packages such as Mathematics Integration, Linear algebra, Statistics, Language Integration, Multidimensional image processing.

## Characteristics of SciPy:  
- It has a huge collection of built in mathematical libraries and functions to support complex scientific computations.
- High level commands for data manipulation and visualization.
- Efficient and fast data processing. Since it is built on top of NumPy, the data processing is extremely fast and efficient.
- Integrates well with multiple systems and environments.
- Large collection of sub-packages for different scientific domanins.
- Its developer friendly libraries and functions, simplifies scientific application development.
